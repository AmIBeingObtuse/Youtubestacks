Ensure docker desktop is installed this should also install with compose - https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

Run command prompt as an administrator

Change directory to where you want to install Netbox (Copy gitfiles).

In mycase the command would be:
cd C:\Users\keith\Downloads\KL Tech Videos Downloads

Now pull the git repository
git clone -b release https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker.git

Now change directory into netbox-docker
cd netbox-docker

Now lets create our yml file (You can edit the port number on the left to change the port, do not edit the right handside port number)
(
echo services:
echo   netbox:
echo     ports:
echo       - "8000:8080"
) > docker-compose.override.yml

Now run it
docker compose up

you will see it failes as unhealthy at first. You must wait circa 2 minutes for everything to spin up.

When the 2 minutes has ended run
docker compose up -d

In seconds you should see everying in green, stated, running and healthy.

Now we need to create our admin user for Netbox.

Make sure your still in the netbox directory.
cd netbox-docker

then run
docker compose exec netbox /opt/netbox/netbox/manage.py createsuperuser

You will enter a username, email and password. Make these secure. You can now go to http://localhost:8000 or change the port to whatever you created and login.
