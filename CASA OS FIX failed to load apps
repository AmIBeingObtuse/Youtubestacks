sudo apt update -y

sudo apt upgrade -y

#(Be carefull docker or other apps are not still upgrading/writing files as you could lose data by rebooting to early, always backup your data first and I suggest waiting at least 5 minutes before a reboot)

sudo reboot

#The fix

sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf

#Enter this in the file above
[Service]
Environment=DOCKER_MIN_API_VERSION=1.24

#(I would recommend stopping all containers gracefully before the following commands are run! I do not accept responsibility for any data loss so listen carefully! BACKUP all data!)

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo systemctl restart docker
