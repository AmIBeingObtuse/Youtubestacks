When in casa os open the terminal don't install via the app store.

Login using your OS username and password.

Run
sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade (Only if you need to as this will upgrade a lot of packages on your system which can break things.)

Run (You can change the port number on the left but not the right handside if you wish to).
sudo git clone -b release https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker.git
cd netbox-docker
sudo tee docker-compose.override.yml <<EOF
services:
  netbox:
    ports:
      - "8000:8080"
EOF

Make sure you are still in the netbox-docker directory before running these commands.

Now run
sudo docker compose pull

when all files have downloaded run
docker compose up

It will fail as unhealthy. You must give it at least circa 2 minutes to spin up.

After 2 minutes run for linux without Casa OS

sudo docker compose up -d

or

sudo docker compose up with Casa OS

the only difference is a detached session is needed without casa os to continue running without stopping the docker containers.

Wait until the Get 200 log messages as shown in the video then create the admin user.
Again make sure you are still in the netbox-docker directory whcih if you closed the terminal on Casa OS you will need to run

netbox-docker

creat the admin user run

sudo docker compose exec netbox /opt/netbox/netbox/manage.py createsuperuser

create your username, email and password.

Then go to your machines ip address and port you created. Such as http://localhost:8000 or replace localhost with your machine ip.
