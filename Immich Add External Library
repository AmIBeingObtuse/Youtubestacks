This will help you add an external library to immich.
A copy of my compose and env is at the bottom of this page!

BACKUP FIRST!!!!!!!!! I DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS.

Alternatively use the instructions below:

1. Go to your compose and env file. Add the following to your env file:

EXTERNAL_LOCATION=C:\Users\keith\Pictures\Immich external #Choose a dir on your host.

2. Go to your compose file and add the following under the upload location in both immich server and micro services under the volumes section:

- ${EXTERNAL_LOCATION}:/usr/src/app/external

So your volumes section should look like this:

- ${UPLOAD_LOCATION}:/usr/src/app/upload
- ${EXTERNAL_LOCATION}:/usr/src/app/external

Again make sure you did that for both immich server section and micro services section in your compose!

Now docker compose up/deploy/what ever you use to start the docker containers and compose file.
Be aware it could take a few minutes for immich to restart everything.

3. Go into your immich server and click on administration. The next to your user click the edit icon. Scroll down until you see external path and enter:

/usr/src/app/external

Click confirm.

4. Top right click your avatar it is a coloured circle with the first letter of your username and click account settings. Scroll down to libraries and click create external library.

5. Click the 3 dot menu next to your new libary and then add path. You will then enter the dir we created above:

/usr/src/app/external

6. Click the 3 dot menu next to your new libary again this time selecting scan new library files.
Immich will then add your external library contents to your server without moving the files.
They should be in date order so if a photo was taken in december 2022 you will need to scroll down to december 2022 to find it.
