These commands are for installing fooocus ai image generator from my youtube video - Fooocus Easy AI images Windows and Linux - https://youtu.be/His6Fkk94-8 

Windows download links: https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus?tab=readme-ov-file#download

Linux (I used ubuntu server - Also make sure your linux has the latest nvidia drivers installed and I also had nvidia toolkit).

First create a directory on your linux machine where you will install Fooocus to -

mkdir /Fooocus

Then install python 3.10 -

sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install python3.10

Then run the commands from the Fooocus github under native python linux - 

git clone https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus.git
cd Fooocus
pip3 install -r requirements_versions.txt

If you have UFW firewall then allow port 7865 - 

sudo ufw allow 7865/tcp

you can then run Fooocus when inside the installed directory using -

nohup sudo python3 entry_with_update.py --listen &

You can confirm its running -

ps aux | grep entry_with_update.py

You can go to http://yourip:7865 (Mine was http://192.168.1.59:7865)

You can kill the process when finished - 

sudo pkill -f entry_with_update.py
