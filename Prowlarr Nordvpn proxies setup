🌐 Configuring NordVPN Proxy for Prowlarr
This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for routing your Prowlarr indexer traffic through a NordVPN SOCKS5 proxy. This setup enhances privacy and can help bypass ISP-level blocking.

📋 Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure you have:

An active NordVPN subscription.

Prowlarr installed and running.

🏗️ Setup Instructions
1. Identify Proxy Server Details 📍
First, you need to select a proxy server location. You can find the specific server addresses in the official NordVPN documentation.

Reference Link: https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/20195967385745-NordVPN-proxy-setup-for-qBittorrent

Action: Navigate to the qBittorrent section of that page and copy the Host Address (e.g., amsterdam.nl.socks.nordhold.net) and the Port (typically 1080).

2. Retrieve Manual Service Credentials 🔑
Your standard NordVPN email and password will not work for SOCKS5 authentication. You must use your unique Service Credentials found in your dashboard.

Dashboard Link: https://my.nordaccount.com/dashboard/nordvpn/

Action: Log in, scroll down to the Manual Setup section, and copy your:

Service Username

Service Password

[!IMPORTANT]

Treat these credentials like a private key. Do not share them or include them in public code commits or screenshots.

3. Configure Proxy in Prowlarr ⚙️
Now, apply these details to Prowlarr to establish the connection.

Open the Prowlarr Web UI.

Navigate to Settings ➡️ Indexers.

Note: Be sure you are in the Settings menu, not the main Indexer dashboard list.

Click the [+] icon under the Proxies section and select SOCKS5.

Fill in the following fields:

Name: NordVPN Proxy

Host: (The address from Step 1)

Port: 1080

Username & Password: (The Service Credentials from Step 2)

4. Implement Tagging for Traffic Routing 🏷️
To ensure specific indexers use the proxy, you must link them using Tags. This ensures that only the traffic you want is routed through the proxy.

In Proxy Settings: Add a specific tag (e.g., proxy-tag) to the proxy configuration you just created.

In Indexer Settings: Go to your individual Torrent or Usenet indexers and add the exact same tag (proxy-tag) to their configuration. This "links" the indexer to the proxy.

✅ Verification
Once configured, use the Test button within the Prowlarr Proxy settings. A green checkmark confirms that Prowlarr is successfully communicating with the NordVPN server.
