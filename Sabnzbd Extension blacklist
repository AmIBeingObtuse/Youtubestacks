#Copy the below extentions into your Sabnzbd blacklist removing any extentions you do want to download.
#This will protect your nzb downloader from downloading viruses, scripts and malware including ransomeware!.

#All of line 4 are the extentions. You can modify it. This is my setup for a purely arrs apps download system so I really only want mkv, mp4, mp4, epub, ebook. Video, tv and books. So the rest I don't need.
#Latley more and more malware are being discovered targeting people automating downloads via tools like the arrs and sab so this really helps.
